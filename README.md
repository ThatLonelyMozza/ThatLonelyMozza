<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name's Solixity, but by family, I go by Sean. I'm one to be lazy as hell when it comes to programming and even lazier when it comes to school. I don't play video games as much as I used to, nor do I attend school in person anymore. I currently hold ownership of a few domains like <kbd>booped.me</kbd>, <kbd>yiffed.us</kbd> (not to be confused with <kbd>yiffed.me</kbd>, owned by Nanofaux), <kbd>solixity.gay</kbd>, <kbd>knotted.me</kbd>, and a few others to not be mentioned for the greater good.</p>
